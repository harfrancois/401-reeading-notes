### The Command Line

The command line/terminal is your machines text base interface. In the previous courses, the commands line have been covered. Its is always useful to review. This section I have added a few commands that I think will be useful.

### Useful Notes

pwd (Print Working Directory)
ls (List the contents of a directory.)
cd (Change Directories)
ls -a (List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.)

Search for a command:

- man -
Look up the manual page for a particular command.
- man -k  < search term >
Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
- /< term >
Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
- n
After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.

mkdir (name) Creating a directory.

rmdir (name) Removing a directory.

touch (name.type) Creating a specific file.

cp (source space destination) Copy a file and past it to a location, or mv to move.

rm (name) Remove a file.
