https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/

Open-source software (OSS) is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individuals and businesses 
who use it, as well as to its programmers.

1. Improve Coding Skills
The only way to truly learn and perfect your craft is to practice, practice, practice.

2. Gain Early Experience
OSS provides young developers with useful and valuable experience often required by companies for employment, even for 
internships and entry-level positions.

3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition
Recognition from members from the OSS community not only encourages and motivates a developer to improve his or her 
skills, it can also create a number of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences 
and events, etc.

4. Greater Job Prospects
Nowadays, when many tech companies receive a CV from a prospective developer, they usually skim over the sheets of 
paper and spend more time investigating the applicant’s Github account.

5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level.
The desire to contribute to this particular piece of OSS stems from wanting to improve it for their own use – either 
by improving certain areas or by developing new features and functionalities.
