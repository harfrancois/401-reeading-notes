Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps 
like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any 
developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.

Django was originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, 
and Jacob Kaplan-Moss.

Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. 
This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged. Typically engineers at the company are paid, in part, to 
work on open source though community involvement from developers outside of the core company occurs as well. While 
this structure has the stability of a wealthy benefactor, there can be confusion around the licensing aspects at 
times.

Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the 
case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others. Typically the lead developer either raises contributions
directly like Evan You of VueJS, offer add-on services like Spark for Laravel, or the founders provide highly-paid
consulting services.

Non-profit - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, 
support, and advance Django.

Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a 
miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of 
contributors.

One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors 
in person. Currently there are DjangoCons in the US, Europe, Australia, and Africa in 2020 for the first time. I hope 
to see some of you there!
