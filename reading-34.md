# Django Settings Best Practices

Different environments. Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. Each 
environment can have its own specific settings (for example: DEBUG = True, more verbose logging, additional apps, 
some mocked data, etc). You need an approach that allows you to keep all these Django setting configurations.

Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for 
third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. This data cannot be stored in VCS.

Sharing settings between team members. You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the 
settings. For example, a developer may add a third-party app or some API integration and fail to add specific settings. 
On large (or even mid-size) projects, this can cause real issues.

Django settings are a Python code. This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility, 
but can also be a problem â€“ instead of key-value pairs, settings.py can have a very tricky logic.

# SSH

SSH, or Secure Shell Protocol, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify 
their remote servers over the internet.

SSH service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure 
that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for 
authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the 
client.
