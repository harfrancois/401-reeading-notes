# Binary_Tree
A binary tree is a data structure in which each node or root has at most two children. They are called the left child
and right child. This means that a node has 2 pointers that connects it to a left node and a right node. Just imagine 
a family tree where each parent/mother has only 2 childred and so on to get a picture of the binary tree.
