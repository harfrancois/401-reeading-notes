# Docker
source - https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/

- Docker is a way to run Linux containers
- Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
- Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
- Images are made up of one or more layers
- Containers are a running instance of an image
docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
- Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more 
complex with database.

# Django API
source - https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/

Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only 
Django Rest Framework. It always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.
We will build out a basic Library website with traditional Django and then extend it into a web API with Django REST 
Framework.
